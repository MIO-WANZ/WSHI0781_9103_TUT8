# Creative Ideas:
## *Inspiration:*
Piet Mondrian's work is inspired by the urban rhythms and energy of New York with its unique geometric abstract style and vibrant colors, which I will use as inspiration for my secondary work using p5.js. I hope to present an exceptional understanding of the modern city in digital media that expresses its energy, complexity, and constant iteration. This project pays homage to Piet Mondrian's artistic style and gives it new life and expression through modern technology.

## *Screen Layout:*
The overall image will use a grid structure, with vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image to form a basic grid layout in the Mondrian style. The use of the primary colors of red, yellow and blue, as well as geometric shapes in white, black and gray, will change over time and with user interaction. To enhance immersion, the canvas will be created larger so that the viewer feels as if they are in the middle of it.

## *Light and Shadow Effects:*
I will be utilizing Perlin noise and randomness techniques to convey my understanding of the modern city. Again the abstract form of Neoplasticism will be used, although Piet Mondrian was keen to use simple colors, I comprehend the modern city to be diverse. Therefore, I will add randomness in color and size to increase the variability of the image. By introducing the Perlin noise algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the transparency, position, and size of the colors, I will add a sense of organicity and variety to the image and simulate the effect of light and shadow in the city at night.

## *Dynamic change:*
I wanted to express the city's changing from morning to night and translate it into the changing of the universe, just as Piet Mondrian explores the harmony and order of the town and the universe. To show the alternation of day and night and the integration and renewal of the city, the image will gradually change from a white background to black. The roads and vehicles of the original work will be replaced by blurred color blocks and circles, presenting an effect of light and particles as if the city were at night.

## *Interactive Design:*
Using keyboard click responses, users can interactively change the position and color of the color blocks to experience the dynamic changes in Mondrian style. The keyboard "G" key is used to increase the interactivity and dynamism of the artwork. At night, the lighted circles of vehicles will begin to gather and disperse, as if in a universe with a big bang. The city is like the universe; the cars, roads, and people are like the planets in the universe, and the world is going round and round again and again. Finally, the image will slowly rise with yellow, red, and blue dots, returning to the simple three primary colors, expressing a sense of returning to the beginning to explore and express the harmony and order of the spiritual world.
